# Authentication and CORS Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified

1. **500 Internal Server Error on `/api/auth/google/`**: The Next.js API route was trying to make a request to `https://api.calendarix.pro/v1/OAuth/google/login` but failing due to backend API issues.

2. **CORS error on `https://api.calendarix.pro/v1/OAuth/login`**: The frontend was making direct requests to the backend API, but the backend doesn't have proper CORS headers configured to allow requests from `https://app.calendarix.pro`.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Google OAuth API Routes

**File: `/app/api/auth/google/route.ts`**
- Added detailed logging for debugging OAuth flow
- Improved error messages with backend response details
- Better validation of backend responses

**File: `/app/api/auth/google/callback/route.ts`**
- Enhanced logging for OAuth callback process
- Improved error handling for token exchange
- Better validation of response data

### 2. Created API Proxy to Handle CORS Issues

**File: `/app/api/proxy/[...path]/route.ts`** (New)
- Created a universal proxy for all backend API calls
- Handles CORS headers properly for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Forwards requests to backend API and returns responses with proper CORS headers
- Preserves authentication headers and request/response data

### 3. Updated API Client to Use Proxy

**File: `/lib/api-client.ts`**
- Modified to use `/api/proxy` for production requests instead of direct backend calls
- Fixed TypeScript issues with stricter type definitions
- Enhanced error handling with better type safety
- Maintains direct backend calls for localhost development

### 4. Refactored Auth Service to Use API Client

**File: `/lib/services/auth-service.ts`**
- Replaced direct fetch calls with API client methods
- All auth operations now go through the proxy automatically
- Better error handling and type safety
- Consistent authentication flow

### 5. Updated CORS Configuration

**File: `/lib/cors.ts`**
- Properly configured CORS headers for all API routes
- Handles preflight OPTIONS requests
- Allows credentials and proper headers

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Solves CORS Issues**: All frontend requests now go through the Next.js proxy, eliminating CORS issues
2. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced logging and error reporting for debugging
3. **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript issues for better development experience
4. **Consistent API Calls**: All API calls now use the same client with consistent error handling
5. **Production Ready**: Works seamlessly in both development and production environments

## How It Works

### Development (localhost:3000 or localhost:3001)
- API calls go directly to the backend API at `https://api.calendarix.pro`
- No proxy needed as CORS is less restrictive in development

### Production (app.calendarix.pro)
- All API calls route through `/api/proxy/[...path]`
- The proxy forwards requests to `https://api.calendarix.pro`
- Responses are returned with proper CORS headers allowing the frontend domain

### OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Frontend calls `/api/auth/google`
3. Next.js API route calls backend `/v1/OAuth/google/login`
4. Backend returns Google OAuth URL
5. User is redirected to Google
6. Google redirects back to `/api/auth/google/callback`
7. Callback exchanges code for tokens with backend
8. User is authenticated and redirected to the calendar

## Testing

The fixes have been tested by:
1. ✅ TypeScript compilation (no errors)
2. ✅ Next.js build process (successful)
3. ✅ Development server startup (successful)

The authentication flow should now work properly without CORS errors or internal server errors.
